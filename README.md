# Autonomous UAV Collision Avoidance via Simulated Collision
University of Edinburgh MSc Cognitive Science dissertation on drone collision avoidance using reinforcement learning and collision heuristics. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have grown rapidly in popularity, especially bene-fiting recently from improvements in autonomous control provided by ReinforcementLearning  (RL).  However,  RL  has  failed  to  solve  the  critical  task  of  UAV  collisionavoidance.  This project aimed to resolve this issue by integrating a collision avoidanc eheuristic, which simulates a realistic collision, into an RL model trained to accomplish a higher-level task.  Two flight controllers were developed and compared:  A hybrid model in which a collisions heuristic was integrated into an RL agent pre-trained toonly accomplish a high-level task and RL agent trained to simultaneously avoid collisions and accomplish a task. We found that the hybrid RL-heuristic flight controller is superior to a solely RL model both in terms of task completion and collision avoidance
